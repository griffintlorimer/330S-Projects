Creative Portion: 
- Users can tag an event with a particular category and chose to show events only of that category on the current month of the calender by entering a category and submitting it
- Users can share their calendar with additional users by entering other users names seperated by whitespace when creating an event
- Users can create group events that display on multiple users calendars by reigstering their user to a group and filling out 


Notes: 
- Sometime when you click on the our buttons they don't seem to work but in fact they do, when you click on them again. We think the issue might be something related to bootstrap since we used it to design our buttons
- Sometimes you will get an alert that you didn't fill in the name/date/time when you are creating/updating an event.  Please click the clock and calender  and chose dates and times from there to avoid this
- We have our login/new user registration on a seperate page.  We thought it was cleaner this way and we saw 'It is OK to have a dedicated page for user login, which redirects to the calendar' from https://piazza.com/class/ky8xiakerco4ka?cid=402
