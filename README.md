## File Sharing Website
The [file sharing website ](http://ec2-44-202-112-86.compute-1.amazonaws.com/~griffinlorimer/m2login.html)
uses pure HTML and pure CSS for the front-end and php on the backend.  Users can create an account with a username, login, upload files, view/download files, and delete them.  All files and user information is stored on an Amazon EC2 instance.
